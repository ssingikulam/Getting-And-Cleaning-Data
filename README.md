# Getting-And-Cleaning-Data
This is part of the project of coursera
The Steps involved are below:
1. Download the data from the link provided and unzip the data.  This data was collected from the acceleromers from Samsung
  Galaxy S Smartphone.
2. Write a script that does the following:
    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
    for each activity and each subject.
The script used for this purpose is rn_analysis.R.  This executes all the steps detailed above and finally writes a tidy file called "tidy_data.txt"
